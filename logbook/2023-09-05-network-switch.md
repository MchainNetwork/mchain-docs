Greetings, Mchain Marine!

We are pleased to bring you exciting news about the latest updates we have made for the MAR token launch.

## Network Switch: From BSC to Ethereum
After careful evaluation and considering the valuable opinions of our community, we have decided to change the network for the launch of our MAR token. Although it was initially planned as a BEP20 token on the BSC network, we are happy to announce that MAR will be launched as an ERC20 token on the Ethereum network, allowing us to take advantage of all the benefits this network offers.

## MAR ERC20 Token: A Fee-Free Experience
We want the experience with the MAR ERC20 token to be as smooth as possible and scale up to the launch of Mchain v2. For this reason, the MAR ERC20 will be a standard token without reflection fees, facilitating transparent and direct transactions and promoting greater adoption and participation in our community.

## Future Integration with BSC through a Bridge
Following the launch of MAR ERC20, you will also enjoy the benefits of the MAR token on the BSC network. We are in the planning stages of a bridge that will allow a smooth connection between the Ethereum and BSC networks, expanding opportunities and accessibility for our community.

## Stay Tuned for Upcoming Updates
We will soon share more details, including the exact launch date. We are committed to keeping our community well-informed at every step of our journey.

Thank you for being a vital member of our growing community!
