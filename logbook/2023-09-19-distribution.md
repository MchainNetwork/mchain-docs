Hello Mchain Enthusiasts,

We are thrilled to introduce a vital update to the Mchain Docs: the addition of the "Distribution of MAR ERC20 Tokens" page.

Scheduled for October 1st, this pivotal event marks a stepping stone towards a prosperous future. The new page encapsulates vital information regarding the creation, distribution, and strategies implemented for the MAR ERC20 tokens.

We encourage all community members to visit this section for an in-depth understanding of the significant strides we are making.

Best,

The Mchain Team
