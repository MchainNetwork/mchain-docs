# Add Binance Smart Chain to Metamask

Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to decentralized applications (DApps) that run on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) blockchains. In this guide, we'll explain how to configure the BSC Mainnet and BSC Testnet on your Metamask so you can interact with the MAR BEP20 token on these networks.

### Choosing Between BSC Mainnet and Testnet

- **BSC Mainnet:** Use the BSC Mainnet to conduct real transactions with BNB and access DApps on the BSC blockchain. Ensure you have real BNB funds before using this network.

- **BSC Testnet:** Utilize the BSC Testnet for testing and experimenting without using real BNB. You can obtain 0.1 BNB daily for testing purposes by entering your Metamask address on the [BSC Testnet faucet](https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart).

### Option 1: Configuration via Chainlist.org

1. Open Metamask and make sure you have the extension installed in your browser. If you need help, you can download it from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).

2. Visit [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) in your browser.

3. On Chainlist.org, search and select the "Binance Smart Chain Mainnet" or "Binance Smart Chain Testnet" network, depending on your needs. If you want to use the Binance Smart Chain Testnet, you'll need to check the "Include Testnets" box on the Chainlist page.

4. Click the "Add to Metamask" button for the network you want to add.

5. A Metamask window will pop up asking if you allow the network change. Click "Switch Network".

6. Now, in the Metamask interface, you can choose this network from the dropdown menu or switch back and forth as needed.

7. Done! You can now interact with the BSC network on Metamask.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

1. Open Metamask and make sure you have the extension installed in your browser. If you need help, you can download it from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).

2. Click on your avatar or profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Settings".

3. In the "Networks" tab, scroll down and click on "Add Network".

4. Fill in the configuration fields as per the table below:

| **Network**              | **New RPC URL**                                  | **Chain ID**        | **Currency Symbol**   | **Block Explorer URL**            |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|

| BSC Testnet              | https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/ | 97                  | BNB                   | https://testnet.bscscan.com       |

5. Click on "Save" to add the network.
