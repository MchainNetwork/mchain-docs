# What is MAR BEP20?

*** A Strategic Step Towards Mainnet ***

Throughout the migration from Mchain v1 to Mchain v2, a key component of the process will be the launch of MAR as a Binance Smart Chain (BSC) token. This initial step aims to provide users with a smooth and beneficial migration path from Mchain v1. During this intermediate period, before the completion and launch of Mchain v2, users will have the opportunity to receive their MAR in the form of this token on BSC, taking advantage of its unique features.

In its initial phase on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), the MAR token will be set up as a reflection tokenâ€”a model renowned for redirecting a portion of each transaction to all token holders. This redistribution occurs proportionally, based on the amount of tokens each holder owns. Moreover, each transaction segment will be allocated to the liquidity pool, and a certain quantity of MAR tokens will be automatically burned.

This reflection token design was carefully chosen to counteract potential price manipulation by "whales" and simultaneously offer enticing incentives for early adopters until the official launch of Mchain v2 Mainnet.

## From Reflection Token to Mchain v2

It's imperative to note that these transaction fee features are temporary. Once the Mchain v2 Mainnet launches, the MAR token will cease functioning as a reflection token and become a regular BEP20 token on BSC. This transformation will be irreversible.

Once the MAR token transitions to a standard BEP20, users can utilize a bridge to transfer their tokens to the Mchain v2 Mainnet. Alternatively, they may continue using them on the BSC, whichever they prefer.
