# MAR BEP20 Specifications

The MAR token will operate as a reflection token during its early phase on Binance Smart Chain (BSC). However, once Mchain v2 Mainnet is launched, it will transition to a standard BEP20 token on BSC, an irreversible change.

## MAR Reflection Token Fee Model

The MAR token will follow a percentage-based fee model. Every transaction made with the MAR token towards the liquidity pool will be subject to a total fee of 10%. This fee will be broken down as follows:

- **Liquidity**: 5% will be directed to the liquidity pool, ensuring the token's stability and security.
- **Burn**: 2.5% will be automatically burned, permanently removing it from circulation.
- **Redistribution**: The remaining 2.5% will be redistributed among all MAR BEP20 token holders.

This model ensures that every MAR token holder benefits from every transaction, thereby promoting long-term holding and discouraging rapid selling.

## Total Supply & Token Decimals

The total amount of MAR BEP20 tokens created is **105,248,200**.

The MAR BEP20 token has a precision of **6 decimals**.

## Transaction Limits

- The maximum transaction amount allowed in a transfer is **1%** of the total supply.
- The highest allowed balance in a single wallet is **5%** of the total supply.
- The number of tokens to swap and add to liquidity is **0.1%** of the total supply.

## Burn Address

The designated burn address for MAR BEP20 is `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD`.

## Important Note

It's crucial to understand that these transaction fee features are temporary. Once the Mchain Mainnet v2 is launched, the MAR token will no longer function as a reflection token. Instead, it will become a standard BEP20 token on the BSC (Binance Smart Chain). This change will be irreversible and final.
