# How to Claim Your MAR ERC20 from Mchain v1 by Signing a Message

If you are an Mchain v1 user and want to claim your MAR tokens in ERC20 format, this article is for you. The claim process requires you to sign a message containing the Ethereum address where you want to receive your MAR ERC2O using your Mchain v1 private key for the signature. Below, we will explain how to do this safely and efficiently.

If you have not previously registered for the claim process, you can do so in the *** [following form](https://forms.gle/9SWZLE8vkGPCrSZc8)***.

## Necessary Tools (Choose One)

1. **Mchain Core**: A software similar to Bitcoin Core that allows you to sign messages quickly.
2. **sign-eth-address.html File**: A downloadable file that, when opened, displays a web interface to carry out the same process.

## Method 1: Using Mchain Core

**Steps:**

1. **Open Mchain Core** on your computer.
2. **Access the wallet** where you have stored your MAR tokens on Mchain v1.
3. **Click on 'File'** in the application's top menu bar.
4. **Navigate to the 'Sign Message' section**.
5. **Enter the MAR address** you'll use to sign the message. This address should contain your MAR tokens and be the one you've registered for claiming MAR ERC20.
6. **Enter your Ethereum address** in the "Message" field, where you wish to receive your MAR ERC20 tokens.
7. **Click 'Sign Message'** to sign the message with your Mchain private key.

Once the message is signed, you will have a digital signature that you can use to verify your Ethereum address and claim your MAR ERC20 tokens. Copy this signature and email it to us, along with your MAR address and your Ethereum address.

## Method 2: Using the sign-eth-address.html File

**Steps:**

1. **Download the sign-eth-address.html file** from the [official website](https://mchain.network/balance/sign-eth-address.html) or a secure link.
2. **Open the downloaded file**, which will launch a web page in your browser.
3. **Locate the interface**, which is divided into two sections.

#### Sign Message

- **Input 1**: Private Key (Enter your Mchain v1 private key here, associated with the address where you have your MAR tokens and have applied for MAR ERC20 claim)
- **Input 2**: Message (Enter the Ethereum address where you want to receive your MAR ERC20 tokens)
- **Button**: Sign Message (Click to sign the message)

After signing, a "Signed Message" notification will appear. Copy this signed message and email it to us along with your MAR address and your Ethereum address.

#### Verify Message

Before sending the email, it's advisable to verify the signed message.

- **Input 1**: Address (Your address in Mchain v1, which should start with 'M')
- **Input 2**: Message (The Ethereum address you entered earlier)
- **Input 3**: Signed Message (The previously obtained signed message)
- **Button**: Verify Message (Click to verify the message)

The application will inform you if the message has been correctly signed upon clicking the button.

## Security Considerations

- **Never share your private key** with anyone.
- **Make sure you are using the official version** of Mchain Core or the sign-eth-address.html file downloaded from a reliable source.

You can claim your MAR ERC20 tokens safely and efficiently by following these simple steps. If you have any questions or require further clarification, please get in touch with the Mchain support team.
