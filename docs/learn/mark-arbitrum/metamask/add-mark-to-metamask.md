# Add MARK Arbitrum to Metamask

This guide'll walk you through adding the MARK Arbitrum token to your Metamask wallet.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have the Metamask extension installed on your browser. If you need help, you can download it from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).
- Have your Metamask wallet set up with a secure password and backup seed phrase.
- Copy the correct [MARK Arbitrum contract address](/docs/learn/mark-arbitrum/specifications) to your clipboard.

### Steps to Add MARK Arbitrum to Metamask

1. **Open Metamask**: Click on the Metamask extension icon on your browser to open it.

2. **Select a Network**: Metamask is configured for the Ethereum Mainnet by default. If you want to add MARK on the Arbitrum network, you can easily add this network to Metamask by following [this guide](/docs/learn/mark-arbitrum/metamask/add-arbitrum-to-metamask).

3. **Add Token**: 
    - Click on the `Menu` (often represented by three horizontal lines on the top left).
    - Choose `Add Token` from the dropdown.

4. **Custom Token**: 
    - Navigate to the `Custom Token` tab.
    - You'll need to enter the MARK token contract address (make sure to get this from the official Mchain website or a trusted source to avoid scams). 
    - Once you've entered the contract address, the other fields, like Token Symbol and Decimals of Precision, should autofill. If not, enter `Mchain Token` for the Token Name, enter `MARK` for the Token Symbol and `18` for Decimals.

5. **Add and Confirm**: 
    - Click the `Next` button to see a summary of the MARK token details.
    - Confirm the details are correct and click `Add Tokens`.

6. **View MARK in Metamask**: After adding, MARK should now be visible in your token list within Metamask. The balance should also reflect here if you have any MARK Arbitrum tokens.

You've successfully added the MARK Arbitrum token to your Metamask wallet! Now, you can easily receive, store, and send MARK tokens using Metamask.
