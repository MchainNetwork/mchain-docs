# How to Stake Your Liquidity

This tutorial will guide you through each step, focusing on how to participate in staking [MARK on Arbitrum](staking-mark-arbitrum.md) once you have provided liquidity.

## Step 1: Preparations

Before you start, you need:

- **A digital wallet**: Ensure you have installed Metamask or any compatible wallet.
- **Available funds**: Your wallet must contain both MARK and ETH on the Arbitrum network.

For detailed instructions on how to provide liquidity on Uniswap V3, see our guide "[Add Liquidity on Uniswap V3](../uniswap/add-liquidity)".

## Step 2: Stake Your Liquidity

Once you have provided liquidity in the Pool and received your Uniswap NFT representing your position, it's time to proceed with staking.

1. **Access the Staking Page**:
   - Go to the MARK Arbitrum staking page: [`https://v3-staker.mchain.network`](https://v3-staker.mchain.network/)

2. **Connect your wallet**:
   - Click "Connect wallet" in the top right corner and select your wallet from the available options list.

3. **Switch to the Arbitrum network**:
   - The page will prompt you to switch if your wallet needs to be added to the Arbitrum network. Follow the instructions to make the change.

Once on the staking page and with your wallet connected, you will see several elements on the screen:

### Incentive Dropdown

You will find a dropdown menu displaying the available staking incentives. Here, you can:

- **Select the appropriate incentive**: Each incentive describes the rewards to be distributed and the time period over which they will be distributed.

### List of Liquidity NFTs

You will see a table listing your liquidity NFTs. Next to each NFT, you will find:

- **Rewards**: The accumulated MARK rewards for each NFT position you have in staking.
- **"Stake" Button**: To start the staking process for a specific NFT.

### Staking Process

Selecting "Stake" next to your liquidity NFT will guide you through the following steps:

1. **Approve**: You must allow the smart contract to interact with your NFT.
2. **Transfer**: Move your NFT to the Uniswap V3 Staker staking contract.
3. **Stake**: Confirm your participation in the selected incentive.

Each action will require you to confirm the transaction in your digital wallet.

## Step 3: Collect Rewards

With your tokens now in staking, MARK rewards will begin to accumulate. You can review and claim these rewards directly from the staking page whenever you wish.
