# Staking MARK on Arbitrum

## What is MARK Staking on Arbitrum?

MARK Arbitrum staking is a new service that allows users who provide liquidity on the Arbitrum network for the MARK-ETH pair on Uniswap V3 to receive additional rewards. By supplying liquidity, you receive a unique Uniswap NFT that represents your contribution. This NFT can be used on our staking page to earn MARK Arbitrum rewards directly from our pool of 17,207,056 MARK allocated for this purpose.

## Double Benefits: Staking and Trading Commissions

Participating in staking and providing liquidity offers double benefits. You will accumulate staking rewards and receive a portion of the 1% of the commissions generated by trading the MARK-ETH pair. This dual advantage positions liquidity providers in a privileged position to earn MARK rewards and continuously benefit from trading commissions.
