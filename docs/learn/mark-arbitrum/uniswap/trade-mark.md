# Trade MARK Arbitrum on Uniswap

### What is Uniswap?

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Ethereum ecosystem. It uses an automated liquidity model, meaning instead of traditional order books, users contribute funds to liquidity pools, and these pools facilitate trades between various ERC20 tokens, including MARK Arbitrum.

### Trading on Uniswap

#### Preparation
Before you begin trading MARK Arbitrum on Uniswap, you need:

1. **Digital Wallet**: Create and set up an Ethereum-compatible wallet, like Metamask or Trust Wallet.
2. **Ethereum (ETH)**: Ensure you have sufficient ETH on Arbitrum One network in your wallet to cover transaction fees (gas).
3. **Copy MARK Arbitrum contract address**: Copy the correct [MARK Arbitrum contract address](/docs/learn/mark-arbitrum/specifications) to your clipboard.

#### Step-by-Step Trading Guide
1. **Access Uniswap**:
   - Visit [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/explore/tokens/arbitrum/0x4D01397994aA636bDCC65c9e8024bC497498c3bb?inputCurrency=ETH&chain=arbitrum) and connect your digital wallet.
2. **Select MARK**: 
   - Once connected, in the "Swap" section, select ETH as your source token and search for MARK in the token list for the destination. If MARK is not listed, you can manually add it using its ERC20 contract address.
3. **Making the Swap**:
   - Enter the amount of ETH you wish to exchange for MARK. Uniswap will automatically show the estimated amount of MARK you will receive.
   - Review the conversion rate and gas fees.
4. **Transaction Confirmation**:
   - Click "Swap" and then confirm the transaction in your digital wallet.
   - Wait for the transaction to process. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the Arbitrum network congestion.
5. **Receiving MARK Arbitrum**: 
   - Once the transaction is complete, the MARK tokens will be added to your wallet.

#### Tips and Best Practices
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Adjust the slippage tolerance to prevent significant price differences during the transaction.
- **Timing of the Transaction**: Consider market volatility and network congestion when making transactions.
- **Verification**: Always verify the MARK token address and the swap conditions before confirming.

#### Risks
As with any cryptocurrency trading, trading MARK involves risks, including market volatility and online security risks. Educate yourself well and never invest more than you are willing to lose.
