# Registering Names in Mchain Name Service (MNS)

The Mchain Name Service (MNS) allows users to register domain names that are easy to remember and use. These domains significantly improve user experience on the blockchain by simplifying transactions and address identification.

## Steps to Register a Name

### Step 1: Choose a Name
   - Select a unique name that ends in `.mark`, such as `yourname.mark`.
   - Ensure the name is easy to remember and relevant to you or your project.

### Step 2: Verify Availability
   - Before registering a domain name, check if the name you want is available. This can be done using the MNS user interface on the Mchain Hub, `mchaind` or trough the API.

### Step 3: Calculate Registration Cost
   - The cost of registration depends on the length of the domain name and the duration of registration.
   - For example, shorter names are generally more expensive than longer ones.
   - The cost is paid in MARK, Mchain's primary currency, and goes towards rewarding the network's stakers and validators.

### Step 4: Complete the Registration
   - Once you have selected and verified the domain, register it through a transaction on Mchain.
   - You must specify the registration duration (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, etc.) and pay the corresponding cost.

### Step 5: Name Configuration
   - After registering, you can configure your domain name by linking it to your Mchain address or setting up subdomains.

## Registration Cost

The registration cost varies depending on the domain name's length and registration duration. Here is an example of how the cost is calculated:

- Single-character domain names may have a significantly higher cost.
- Two-character names may cost half as much as one-character names.
- As the number of characters increases, the cost decreases proportionally.

For example, a 3-character name might cost 8 times the base cost, while a 5-character name might cost twice the base cost. The base cost is defined in `umark`, a subunit of the MARK currency.

## MNS Referral System

MNS also offers a referral system, where you can earn commissions by referring new users to the service. By registering a domain name with your account and sharing the Mchain Hub link with your referral code, you can receive commissions from each registration, renewal, and domain sale made through your link.

The referral system is an excellent way to actively participate in the Mchain community and benefit financially at the same time.
