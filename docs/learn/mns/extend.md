# Extending the Lifespan and Updating Names in MNS

The Mchain Name Service (MNS) not only allows for the registration of names but also for extending their lifespan and updating their details.

## Extending the Lifespan of a Domain

1. **Select the Name**: Choose the name you wish to extend.
2. **Choose the Duration**: Decide how much additional time you want to extend your domain. It can be for one, two, or three years.
3. **Make the Payment**: Extending a domain involves a cost calculated based on the additional duration. This payment is made in MARK, the primary cryptocurrency of Mchain.

## Domain Data Update

- **Change the Associated Address**: You can modify the Mchain address associated with your domain.
- **Update Metadata**: Add or change the metadata associated with your domain to reflect changes or new information.
- **Secure Modification**: All updates must be made through your secure account.

## Tools for Extension and Update

- **CLI `mchaind`**: For technical users, using the CLI allows these operations to be carried out directly and in an advanced manner.
- **Mchain Hub**: The graphical interface makes extending and updating domains user-friendly and accessible.
- **Mchain API**: Developers can automate and customize domain management using the API.

## Important Considerations

- **Costs and Fees**: Be aware of the costs of extending and updating domains.
- **Account Security**: Secure your account to prevent unauthorized domain modification.
- **Expiration Reminders**: Stay alert to system notifications about the impending expiration date of your domains.
