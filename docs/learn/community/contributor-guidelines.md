# Mchain Docs Contributor Guidelines

Welcome to the Mchain Docs community! Your interest in improving our documentation is greatly appreciated. Here's a quick guide on how you can effectively contribute.

## Overview

To ensure consistency and quality in our documentation:

1. **Getting Started**: Familiarize yourself before contributing.
2. **Ways to Contribute**: Understand different methods to offer your expertise.
3. **Contribution Ideas**: Gain clarity on what contributions can be most impactful.

## Getting Started

Before diving in:

- Identify issues by going to the Issues section and providing comprehensive details.
- Seek technical help or clarifications on the designated platform if needed.
- If you're planning to contribute to the repository directly, your contribution might include the following:
  - Correcting spelling or grammar.
  - Refining code formatting.
  - Fixing broken links.

All contributions should be made via a pull request. Each pull request should address a single topic or fix. 

If you're unfamiliar with GitHub or creating pull requests, several beginner guides are available on GitHub to assist you.

## Ways to Contribute

The master repository contains the core documentation for the docs.mchain.network portal, primarily aimed at Mchain developers.

### Small Fixes

For minor adjustments, such as text edits:

1. Click "Edit this page".
2. Make corrections directly on GitHub.
3. Briefly describe your changes in the commit message and commit.
4. Choose "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

### Branching and Pull Requests

For significant updates:

1. Visit the mchain-docs public repository.
2. Fork or clone the repository locally.
3. Create a new branch using a command similar to:
   ```
   git switch -c your-initials/branch-name
   ```

Follow subsequent steps akin to the provided example to finalize your updates. Then, initiate a pull request for review.

## Contribution Ideas

Valuable contributions often come in detailed guides or tutorials to support other developers.

If you're contemplating a contribution, here's a distinction between a "detailed guide" and a "tutorial":

### Detailed Guides

These provide clear instructions to reach specific goals. They emphasize essential steps and exclude unrelated information.

### Tutorials

Tutorials are comprehensive, step-by-step lessons for readers new to the subject. They guide the reader from start to finish on a specific task.

Your insights will significantly enhance Mchain Docs. We look forward to your input. Celebrate every successful contribution! ðŸš€
