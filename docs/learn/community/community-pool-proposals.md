# Community Pool Proposals

The Community Pool in Mchain represents a significant aspect of the blockchain's governance mechanism. It accumulates funds through various means like transaction fees, and these funds are meant to be allocated for proposals that benefit the Mchain ecosystem. Understanding how to manage, propose, and vote for the utilization of these funds is crucial for community members.

## How the Community Pool Works

1. **Accumulation of Funds**: The Community Pool gathers resources primarily through a portion of block rewards and transaction fees. 

2. **Purpose**: These funds are intended for proposals that contribute to the development, improvement, and growth of the Mchain ecosystem.

3. **Accessibility**: Any member of the Mchain community can propose how these funds should be used.

## Creating a Proposal

1. **Proposal Submission**: Proposals are submitted to the blockchain and typically include detailed descriptions, objectives, and justifications for the requested funds.

2. **Deposit Requirement**: To prevent spam, proposals require a minimum deposit in MARK tokens. This deposit can be crowdfunded and is refunded if the proposal passes.

3. **Phases of a Proposal**:
   - **Deposit Period**: Time allotted for the proposal to gather the necessary deposit.
   - **Voting Period**: Once the deposit threshold is met, the proposal enters the voting period, where validators and their delegators can vote.

4. **Proposal Types**: Proposals can range from funding community events, software development, marketing initiatives, to educational content.

## Examples of Proposals

- **Development Grants**: Proposals for funding specific development projects or improvements to the Mchain infrastructure.
- **Community Events**: Organizing meetups, hackathons, or conferences.
- **Educational Programs**: Initiatives to educate new users about Mchain and its ecosystem.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Proposals aimed at promoting Mchain to a broader audience.

## How to Submit a Proposal

1. **Draft the Proposal**: Clearly articulate the purpose, goals, and financial requirements in your proposal draft.

2. **Gather Support**: Engage with the community to gather feedback and improve your proposal.

3. **Submit on the Blockchain**: Use the Mchain governance module to submit your proposal along with the required deposit.

4. **Campaign for Votes**: Once your proposal is live, advocate within the community to gather votes.

## Voting on Proposals

- Validators and their delegators have the right to vote on proposals.
- Votes are counted, and a proposal is accepted or rejected based on predefined criteria like quorum and threshold percentages.
