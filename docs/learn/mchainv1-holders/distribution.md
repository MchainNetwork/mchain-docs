## Creation and Distribution of MAR ERC20 Tokens

The Mchain community is taking a significant step in creating 110,000,000 MAR ERC20 tokens. It has been established that 105,248,200 tokens will be distributed among Mchain v1 holders, ensuring that no more MAR ERC20 tokens will be produced in the future.

## Liquidity Provision and Lock-Up

A total of 4,751,800 MAR tokens are allocated explicitly for providing liquidity on Uniswap V3, totalling 110,000,000 MAR ERC20 tokens to be created alongside the 105,248,200 tokens for Mchain v1 holders. These tokens will be locked in the Uniswap V3 pool for a determined period, after which they will be used to benefit the Mchain community in various ways.

## Burn Process

Users can burn MAR tokens using the "burn" function incorporated into the platform's smart contract, helping maintain economic balance and potentially increasing the token's value over time.

## Claim Process

Suppose you are interested in participating in this migration and taking advantage of the benefits of the new blockchain. In that case, we invite you to complete the *** [following form](https://forms.gle/9SWZLE8vkGPCrSZc8) *** to join the list of individuals interested in the coin swap. This list will help us communicate with you and provide more information about the migration process.

Tokens not claimed by October 1st can be acquired on two later dates, November 1st and December 1st, with a deduction of 33.33% of MAR tokens at each unattended phase. Unclaimed tokens will be redistributed according to a new strategy.

## New Redistribution Strategy

Unclaimed tokens will be redistributed as follows to ensure equitable and sustainable growth of the platform:

|---------------------------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|

| Airdrops                        | 10%            | Attract new users to the platform                             |

| Community Reserves              | 15%            | Fund community initiatives and social projects                |
| Staking Provider on Uniswap V3  | 30%            | Encourage participation in the liquidity pool                 |
| Innovation Fund                 | 15%            | Fund innovative projects within the community                 |

## MAR ERC20 Staking: Uniswap V3 Staker

In addition, a novel staking system will be introduced through Uniswap V3 Staker, allowing liquidity providers to engage in staking their liquidity position NFTs in the MAR/ETH pool on Uniswap V3, creating new revenue opportunities for community members.
