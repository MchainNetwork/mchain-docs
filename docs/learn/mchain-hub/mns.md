# Mchain Name Service (MNS)

The Mchain Name Service (MNS) is a decentralized protocol aimed at simplifying human interactions with the Mchain blockchain. Similar to how DNS (Domain Name System) allows you to access websites without remembering complex IP addresses, MNS enables users to interact with blockchain addresses and dApps through human-readable names.

**Testnet URL:** https://testnet.hub.mchain.network/mchain/mns

### Key Features of MNS
- **Human-Readable Names**: Converts blockchain addresses (like 'm1kfo...') into readable names ('yourName.mark').
- **Decentralization**: Built on the Mchain blockchain, MNS is resistant to censorship and disruption.
- **Name Ownership**: Users have full ownership of their MNS domain names, meaning total control over their associated subdomains and records.
- **Interoperability**: MNS is compatible with various cryptocurrencies and services, facilitating its use across different applications and dApps.

### How Does MNS Work?
1. **Domain Registration**: Users can register names ending in '.mark' (e.g., 'yourName.mark'), linked to their Mchain addresses.
2. **Name Resolution**: When you send cryptocurrencies to 'yourName.mark', MNS translates that name into the corresponding Mchain address.
3. **Reverse Lookup**: Allows checking which domain name is associated with a particular Mchain address.
4. **Subdomain Management**: Domain owners can create subdomains (like 'payment.yourName.mark') for different purposes or services.

### Getting Started with MNS
If you're interested in using or registering your name in MNS, here are some basic steps to get started:
1. **Set Up a Digital Wallet**: You will need a Mchain-compatible wallet like Keplr to interact with MNS.
2. **Acquire MARK**: Registering a name in MNS typically requires MARK to pay for the transaction.
3. **Choose a Name**: Think of a meaningful and relevant name for you or your business.
4. **Register Your Name**: Use the MNS user interface to check the availability of your name and complete the registration.

### Navigating the MNS
- **.mark Domain Registration**: Secure a unique identity on the blockchain by registering your .mark domain.
- **Decentralized Services Access**: Utilize your .mark domain to access a world of decentralized services on Mchain.
- **Domain Availability Check**: Use the Mchain Hub's interface to verify if your desired .mark domain is available or already registered.
- **Domain Bidding and Sales**: Participate in domain bidding or place your domain for sale, enhancing the dynamic ecosystem of Mchain.
- **Ownership and Management**: Control and manage your domains, subdomains, and associated data with full ownership rights.

### Referral System

The MNS in Mchain incorporates a referral system allowing users to earn rewards for promoting .mark domains. This feature enables users to be a part of Mchain's growth and benefit from it.

Simply add `?ref=yourdomain.mark` to the end of the Mchain Hub URL, like this: `https://testnet.hub.mchain.network/mchain/mns?ref=yourdomain.mark`, to create your unique referral link.
