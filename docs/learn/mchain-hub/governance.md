# Mchain Governance

Governance on Mchain is a critical aspect that allows community participation in the decision-making process of the network. It's a way for token holders to exercise their voice on various proposals that can shape the future of Mchain.

### What You Can Do in Governance
- **Submit Proposals**: Users can propose changes or new features for the Mchain network. 
- **Vote on Proposals**: Token holders can vote on submitted proposals, influencing their outcome.
- **Deposit Tokens**: To show support, users can deposit tokens on proposals they believe in.

### Understanding the Governance Process
- **Proposal Submission**: Users submit proposals, which are then open for deposits.
- **Deposit Period**: A phase where users deposit tokens on proposals. Proposals with enough deposits move to the voting phase.
- **Voting Period**: Token holders vote on proposals. Votes can be for, against, or abstain.
- **Proposal Outcomes**: Based on the votes, proposals can be passed, rejected, or fail to reach quorum.

### Key Aspects
- **Title and Description**: Every proposal has a title and a detailed description.
- **Timeline**: Proposals have specific timelines indicating submission, deposit, and voting periods.
- **Tally of Votes**: The count of votes for, against, abstain, and total votes.
- **Proposal Statuses**: Statuses include deposit period, voting period, passed, rejected, and failed.

### How to Participate
- **Visiting the Governance Section**: Go to Mchain's governance section to view and participate in active proposals.
- **Voting and Depositing**: Use your tokens to vote on proposals or deposit to show support.
