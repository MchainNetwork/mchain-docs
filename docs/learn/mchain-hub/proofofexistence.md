# Proof of Existence

Proof of Existence is an innovative tool that uses blockchain technology to secure the authenticity and existence of your digital files. Here's how you can easily create a proof of existence for your documents or digital assets.

### Step 1: Prepare Your File
Before you begin, ensure that the file you want to verify is ready. It can be any type of document or digital asset, such as a PDF, an image, or an audio file.

### Step 2: Access the Proof of Existence Page
Visit the Proof of Existence webpage. Here you'll find a user-friendly interface that guides you through the process.

### Step 3: Upload Your File
On the main page, you'll see an option to "Drag and drop a file here" or click to select a file from your computer.

**Important**: The proof of existence only generates and uploads the hash of your file directly from your browser. The actual content of the file is not uploaded or stored on their servers, ensuring your security and privacy.

### Step 4: Hash Creation
Once you select or drag your file, the platform will automatically generate a unique hash of your file and check if it is already registered on the blockchain. This hash is a digital representation of your file's content.

### Step 5: Blockchain Registration
If the generated hash is not yet registered on the blockchain, you can register it by clicking on the “Add proof to the blockchain” button. This will create a proof of the existence of your file stored on the blockchain.

### Step 6: Proof Confirmation
After registration, you'll receive confirmation that your proof has been stored on the blockchain. This proof will include details such as the creator, the block height on the blockchain, the hash of the proof, and the date and time of registration.

### Step 7: Verification
At any time, you can verify the authenticity and existence of your file using the same file upload function or the hash input field. By adding the file or clicking on verify hash, the interface will display the stored proof of existence.
