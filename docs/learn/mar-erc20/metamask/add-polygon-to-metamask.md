# Add Polygon PoS to Metamask

Metamask is a cryptocurrency wallet and gateway to decentralized applications (DApps) that run on Ethereum, Polygon PoS (formerly Matic) and other EVM blockchains. In this guide, we'll explain how to configure the Polygon PoS Mainnet and Mumbai Testnet on your Metamask so you can interact with the MAR ERC20 token on these networks.

### Choosing Between Polygon PoS Mainnet and Testnet

- **Polygon PoS Mainnet:** Use the Polygon PoS Mainnet to conduct real transactions with MATIC and access DApps on the Polygon PoS blockchain. Ensure you have real MATIC funds before using this network.

- **Mumbai Testnet:** Utilize the Mumbai Testnet for testing and experimenting without using real MATIC. You can obtain test MATIC daily for testing purposes by entering your Metamask address on the [Mumbai Testnet faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/).

### Option 1: Configuration via Chainlist.org

1. Open Metamask and ensure the extension is installed in your browser. If you need help, you can download it from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).

2. Visit [Chainlist.org](https://chainlist.org/) in your browser.

3. On Chainlist.org, search and select the "Polygon PoS Mainnet" or "Mumbai Testnet" network, depending on your needs. If you want to use the Mumbai Testnet, you'll need to check the "Include Testnets" box on the Chainlist page.

4. Click the "Add to Metamask" button for the network you want to add.

5. A Metamask window will pop up asking if you allow the network change. Click "Switch Network".

6. Now, in the Metamask interface, you can choose this network from the dropdown menu or switch back and forth as needed.

7. Done! You can now interact with the Polygon PoS network on Metamask.

### Option 2: Manual Configuration

1. Open Metamask and ensure the extension is installed in your browser. If you need help, you can download it from the [official website](https://metamask.io/).

2. Click on your avatar or profile picture in the top-right corner and select "Settings".

3. In the "Networks" tab, scroll down and click on "Add Network".

4. Fill in the configuration fields as per the table below:

| **Network**              | **New RPC URL**                                  | **Chain ID**        | **Currency Symbol**   | **Block Explorer URL**            |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Polygon PoS Mainnet     | https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/             | 137                 | MATIC                 | https://polygonscan.com/   |
| Mumbai Testnet          | https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/              | 80001               | MATIC                 | https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/ |

5. Click on "Save" to add the network.

6. In the top bar of the Metamask window, select "Polygon PoS Mainnet" or "Mumbai Testnet" from the network dropdown, based on your preference.
