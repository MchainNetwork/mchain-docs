# Add Liquidity on Uniswap V3

Uniswap V3, the latest version of the popular decentralized exchange, introduces several new features for liquidity providers. This guide will walk you through the process of adding liquidity to a MAR ERC20 and Ethereum (ETH) pool.

## Understanding Uniswap V3
Uniswap V3 offers greater efficiency and flexibility compared to its predecessors. Key features include concentrated liquidity and multiple fee tiers, allowing liquidity providers to earn more with less capital.

## Prerequisites
Before adding liquidity, ensure you have:
1. **A Digital Wallet**: Set up a wallet compatible with Ethereum, like MetaMask.
2. **Holdings in MAR and ETH**: You need both tokens in your wallet, in a ratio based on the current pool price.
3. **Enough ETH for Transaction Fees**: Gas fees can fluctuate, so have extra ETH available.

## Steps to Add Liquidity
1. **Connect to Uniswap V3**: 
   - Visit the Uniswap Interface at [Uniswap V3](https://app.uniswap.org/#/pool) and connect your wallet.
2. **Select the Pool**:
   - Navigate to the "Pool" section and click on "New Position".
   - Choose MAR and ETH from the token list. If MAR isn't listed, add it manually using its contract address.
3. **Set Price Range**:
   - In Uniswap V3, you need to set a price range for your liquidity. Your liquidity will only earn fees when the price of the token pair is within this range.
4. **Determine Your Liquidity Amount**:
   - Decide how much MAR and ETH you want to contribute. The interface will guide you on the ratio based on the current market price.
5. **Select Fee Tier**:
   - Choose from the available fee tiers. Higher fees can sometimes mean more earnings, but also come with higher risks.
6. **Review and Add Liquidity**:
   - Review the details of your position, including the minimum and maximum prices, and the amount of tokens you're contributing.
   - Confirm the transaction in your wallet and wait for it to process.

## Monitoring and Adjusting Your Position
- Once added, you can monitor your liquidity position on the Uniswap interface.
- You can adjust your price range or add/remove liquidity based on market conditions.

## Risks and Considerations
- **Impermanent Loss**: When the price of the token pair diverges significantly, you might face impermanent loss.
- **Gas Fees**: High gas fees can impact profitability, especially with smaller amounts of capital.
