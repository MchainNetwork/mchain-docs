# Trade MAR ERC20 on Uniswap

### What is Uniswap?

Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) in the Ethereum ecosystem. It uses an automated liquidity model, meaning instead of traditional order books, users contribute funds to liquidity pools, and these pools facilitate trades between various ERC20 tokens, including MAR ERC20.

### Trading on Uniswap

#### Preparation
Before you begin trading MAR ERC20 on Uniswap, you need:

1. **Digital Wallet**: Create and set up an Ethereum-compatible wallet, like MetaMask or Trust Wallet.
2. **Ethereum (ETH)**: Ensure you have sufficient ETH in your wallet to cover transaction fees (gas).
3. **Copy MAR ERC20 contract address**: Copy the correct [MAR ERC20 contract address](/docs/learn/mar-erc20/specifications) to your clipboard.

#### Step-by-Step Trading Guide
1. **Access Uniswap**:
   - Visit [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org) and connect your digital wallet.
2. **Select MAR**: 
   - Once connected, in the "Swap" section, select ETH as your source token and search for MAR in the token list for the destination. If MAR is not listed, you can manually add it using its ERC20 contract address.
3. **Making the Swap**:
   - Enter the amount of ETH you wish to exchange for MAR. Uniswap will automatically show the estimated amount of MAR you will receive.
   - Review the conversion rate and gas fees.
4. **Transaction Confirmation**:
   - Click "Swap" and then confirm the transaction in your digital wallet.
   - Wait for the transaction to process. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes, depending on the Ethereum network congestion.
5. **Receiving MAR ERC20**: 
   - Once the transaction is complete, the MAR tokens will be added to your wallet.

#### Tips and Best Practices
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Adjust the slippage tolerance to prevent significant price differences during the transaction.
- **Timing of the Transaction**: Consider market volatility and network congestion when making transactions.
- **Verification**: Always verify the MAR token address and the swap conditions before confirming.

#### Risks
As with any cryptocurrency trading, trading MAR involves risks, including market volatility and online security risks. Educate yourself well and never invest more than you are willing to lose.
