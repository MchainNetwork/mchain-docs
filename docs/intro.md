# Mchain Documentation

*** Welcome to the official Mchain documentation section! ***

At this initial stage, we're excited to offer a comprehensive tutorial on our MAR BEP20 token's operation. This guide will give you a clear understanding of its functionality, features, and benefits.

Soon, we'll expand our documentation to cover a broader range of topics. You can look forward to detailed guides and tutorials about the Mchain blockchain, including how to run a node, information on validators, and much more.

If you have questions or require immediate assistance, we invite you to contact our support team through our Telegram channel.

We appreciate your patience and interest in Mchain. Delivering a high-quality user experience is paramount to us, and we're dedicated to ensuring you have all the resources you need to make the most of our platform.

Stay tuned for more updates and additions to our documentation!
