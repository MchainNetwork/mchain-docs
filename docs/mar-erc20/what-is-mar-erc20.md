# What is MAR ERC20?

*** A Strategic Step Towards Mainnet ***

Throughout the migration from Mchain v1 to Mchain v2, a key component of the process will be the launch of MAR as a Ethereum (ERC20) token. This initial step aims to provide users with a smooth and beneficial migration path from Mchain v1. During this intermediate period, before the completion and launch of Mchain v2, users will have the opportunity to receive their MAR in the form of this token on Ethereum, taking advantage of its unique features.

## From ERC20 to Mchain v2

Users can utilize a bridge to transfer their tokens to the Mchain v2 Mainnet. Alternatively, they may continue using them on the Ethereum, whichever they prefer.
