# Developer's Guide to Mchain

Welcome to the Mchain developer documentation. This section provides all the resources, guides, and tools you need to build, deploy, and manage applications on the Mchain blockchain.

## Understanding Mchain

Mchain is a blockchain platform designed for adaptability and scalability. It integrates features from the Cosmos SDK and CometBFT (formerly Tendermint) consensus, making it an ideal choice for developers looking to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology.

**Key Features:**

- **Interoperability**: Built on the Cosmos network, Mchain supports IBC (Inter-Blockchain Communication), allowing seamless interactions with other IBC-enabled blockchains.
- **Scalability**: Optimized for high throughput and low transaction fees.
- **Flexibility**: Offers a variety of modules and functionalities, such as Smart Tokens, Governance, and Mchain Name Service (MNS), providing a rich environment for decentralized application (dApp) development.

## Tools and Languages

Mchain supports various programming languages and tools, catering to a wide range of developers. Whether you're proficient in JavaScript, Go, or other languages, Mchain's extensive ecosystem ensures you can work in a language you're comfortable with.

**Core Tools:**

- **mchaind (CLI)**: The command-line interface for interacting with the Mchain blockchain.
- **gRPC/REST APIs**: Enables integration with various front-end frameworks and backend systems.
