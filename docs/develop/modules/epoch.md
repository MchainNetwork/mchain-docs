# Epoch Module (Under Development)

The Epoch Module represents an exciting development within the Mchain platform. It's a feature designed to segment blockchain operations into distinct time periods known as "epochs."

An epoch in the blockchain world is akin to a season in a year, bringing its own unique events and operations. This concept of epochs is particularly innovative for games created on Mchain, as it allows for the structuring of game beginnings, endings, and other significant events within a well-defined timeframe.

Key features and potential applications of the Epoch Module include:

- **Scheduled Operations**: Employing epochs to schedule recurring tasks, such as network updates or smart contract executions, within the blockchain.
- **Governance Integration**: The module may work in tandem with the platform's governance system, enabling stakeholders to influence epoch-related decisions, like adjusting epoch durations or scheduling specific events.
- **Reward Distribution**: For games and other applications, epochs can be the basis for calculating and distributing rewards, including Smart Token incentives and game rewards.
- **Modular Design**: The Epoch Module is envisioned to maintain a modular framework, ensuring smooth integration and compatibility with the Mchain ecosystem's existing and future modules.
