# Oracle Module (Under Development)

Currently under development, the Oracle Module aims to seamlessly integrate external real-world data with blockchain functionalities, greatly enhancing the capabilities and scope of smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) on Mchain.

Key Aspects of the Oracle Module:

- **Real-world Data Integration**: The module is designed to fetch and validate data from external sources, bridging the gap between off-chain events and on-chain actions.
- **Diversity in Data Sources**: It will be capable of sourcing a wide range of data types, from financial markets to environmental statistics, catering to various use cases.
- **Focus on Security and Decentralization**: Emphasizing security and decentralized data sourcing, the module aims to reduce risks like manipulation or centralized points of failure.
